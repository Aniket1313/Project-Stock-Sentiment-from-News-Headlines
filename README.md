# Project-Stock-Sentiment-from-News-Headlines

The main motive behind this project is to scrape news headlines for FB and TSLA then apply sentiment analysis to generate investment insight.

The datasets used in this project are raw HTML files for the Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA) stocks from FINVIZ.com, a popular website dedicated to stock information and news.
